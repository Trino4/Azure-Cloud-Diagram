# About my Azure-Cloud-Diagram 
My basic Azure cloud diagram visually represents the essential Azure services and components utilized within a cloud infrastructure setup. It outlines the network architecture, including Virtual Networks, Subnets, and Network Security Groups, illustrating how various components are interconnected. Identity and Access Management (IAM) through Azure Active Directory is depicted, alongside data services like Azure SQL Database and Azure Blob Storage for data management. Compute resources such as Virtual Machines and Azure App Services are shown, along with integration services like Azure Service Bus and Azure Logic Apps for application communication. Monitoring and management tools like Azure Monitor and Azure Security Center are included, emphasizing performance, security, and compliance. Additionally, hybrid connectivity solutions like Azure ExpressRoute or VPN Gateway may be illustrated, along with considerations for geographical regions, security measures, and compliance certifications, providing a comprehensive overview of the Azure cloud environment.
